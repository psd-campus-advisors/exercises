# Workflow:

**Will you keep all course materials in a repository? Or just assignments?**

Most course materials will be kept in a repo.

**When will you expect students to commit?**

Often, emphasizing atomic code changes per commit

**What sort of commit messages should they use?**

Direct, focusing on exactly what the commit contributed to the project

**When do you want your students to push their code to GitHub?**

Whenever feedback is required, or major milestones are hit.
