## Existing technical student communities on campus:

At the moment, technical communities are few and far between. We play a role of introducing web technologies to high school students as part of Career and Technical Education curriculums. Largely, the school district works to remove the barriers to entry related to cost and access to educational resources that students in our area would otherwise be impacted by.

Currently, our difficulty is two-fold: educators are in need of guidance with respect to what skills students need to learn in order to prepare for careers in web and software development, and students are in need of a consistent academic platform to grow from. GitHub Classroom will help in solving those two issues significantly.

## Choose one GitHub Education program:

Hackathon support would be incredible. We're currently coming up with ways of tying students who have chosen different CTE paths together to work on projects where they can each contribute something they're interested in would be great. Pasco schools currently have a collaborative project focused teams of students forming companies to solve community problems; offering hackathons would be an interesting new avenue for PSD.

## What would I need to do:

I'm in a unique position: I'm not an educator directly. I work at the district admin level to help align our curriculum and teachers with real-world tech methodologies and disciplines. I'm going through the campus advisor program in order to better assist our teachers in learning the fundamentals of GitHub and teaching them in their classrooms. I've used GitHub for years as a web developer so integrating its use in our curriculum is really a no-brainer, but to folks who haven't been using it, there's a fairly steep learning curve that I'm hoping to help overcome.

Student tech communities are really just an extension of having a strong learning foundation. Our kids are looking to work toward building their careers now; and having a GitHub repo as a resume speaks volumes. Couple that with building collaboratively across different disciplines, and I think our kids will build some amazing things.
